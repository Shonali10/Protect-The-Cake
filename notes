if we are not putting else condition in line 130,then even after suzie stops touching the spray, the ants are unconcious or not moving
when putting the else condition and writing bounce off and velocity code (for ants) in it, and removing from the function draw, then ants are bouncing rapidly  (i think looping)
when writing bounce off and velocity code (for ants) in a new function andd calling it in else condition then also ants are bouncing rapidly
what can be done to make the ants bounce off but become unconcious(still) when suzie is touching spray?
